# What State to Live In — Data-Driven State Comparison

## Overview

This project analyzes data across U.S. states to help answer: *What’s the best state to live in?* It combines datasets on healthcare, job opportunities, climate, education, cost of living, and crime.

## Goals

- Clean and merge data from multiple sources
- Explore correlations between key quality-of-life factors
- Identify top and bottom ranked states based on specific metrics
- Visualize insights using bar charts and heatmaps

## Key Features

- Merged 6 real-world datasets on state-level statistics
- Renamed and cleaned columns for consistency
- Created a summary DataFrame for easier comparison
- Performed correlation analysis to interpret how factors relate
- Visualized rankings and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Merging, Cleaning, and Exploration
- Correlation Matrix and Heatmap Interpretation

## Findings

- States with lower crime rates, better healthcare, and higher costs of living tended to rank higher overall.
- Total crime rates are strongly influenced by non-violent crime.
- Strong negative correlation between healthcare quality and affordability.
